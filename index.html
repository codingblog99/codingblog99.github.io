    technology sector and want to learn programming languages,
    but you don't know where to begin, you have come to the right 
    place. With the many programming languages emerging,
    it is difficult to decide which one to learn first.
    But my blog can help you with that. In this blog, 
    you will find detailed discussions about all the 
    major programming languages and my preference about 
    which programming language to learn first.

        Python is an emerging language that is both effective and easy-to-use. 
        Developed in the late 1980s, it has transformed into 
        a language that is convenient for beginners and veterans both. It is 
        one of the favourite languages of programmers due to its easy syntax 
        and vast usage. You can accomplish almost any task using this amazing language.

            Though HTML and CSS are two different languages, 
            one could count them as one as both are of no use without each other. 
            The primary function of these languages is to create a website. 
            HTML is the framework, while CSS gives the decoration to the website.
            With simple words as code, it is easy for beginners as well. 
            But one can create outstanding websites with these languages. 
            For example, this website is made purely using HTML and CSS. 
            It is must-learn for all web designers.
